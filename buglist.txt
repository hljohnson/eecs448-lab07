My Guesses for the 4 Bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. size() - instead of returning correct list size, this method returns the list size + 1
2. isEmpty() - returns false on a non empty list - I believe this is because the method is using size, which would be returning size of 1
on an empty list.
3. addBack(T value) - the first call of this method on a list is successful, adding a node to the list with the passed in value set as its value.
All subsequent calls to addBack will still successfully add nodes to the back of this list, but their values will all be the value that was passed
in to the first call to this method on the list.
        For example: If I called addBack(5) addBack(4) addBack(3) on an empty list, the list would now be 5 -> 5 -> 5 instead of the
        expected 5 -> 4 -> 3
4. removeFront() - this method is performing the same functionality as removeBack()
